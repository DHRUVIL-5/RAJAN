## What is RAJAN?

RAJAN is an AI-powered ethical hacking agent that automates the entire penetration testing workflow. Unlike traditional scanning tools that simply run commands, RAJAN **thinks**, **plans**, **adapts**, and **chains discoveries together** — exactly the way an experienced human pentester would.

You give it a target and a scope. RAJAN takes over from there — running reconnaissance, scanning ports, fingerprinting technologies, testing for dozens of vulnerability types, mapping findings to MITRE ATT&CK, identifying how vulnerabilities chain together for greater impact, and delivering a professional report when it's done. You can walk away and come back to results.

It runs entirely from the command line — on your Android phone via Termux, on Kali Linux, on any Linux system, macOS, or Windows WSL. No GUI needed. No Docker. No heavy setup. Just Python.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Autonomous Operation
RAJAN works completely on its own once you give it a target. It builds a plan, executes each task in the correct dependency order, and dynamically re-plans based on what it discovers. After every few completed tasks, RAJAN analyzes its own results and asks its AI brain whether new tests should be added — so if it discovers a WordPress install halfway through, it automatically adds WordPress-specific CVE checks to the queue. Sessions can run for hours unattended.

### 🗣️ Natural Language Interface
You don't need to memorize flags or commands. Just type what you want:
- *"scan example.com for vulnerabilities"*
- *"what is SSRF and how do I test for it?"*
- *"show me XSS payloads"*
- *"look up CVE-2021-44228"*
- *"generate a report"*

RAJAN understands your intent and routes it to the right module automatically.

### 💬 Interrupt Chat While Working
While RAJAN is running an autonomous scan, you can still talk to it at any time by prefixing your message with `!`. Ask it questions, redirect its focus, check progress, or pause it — all without stopping the scan.

### ⛓️ Vulnerability Chain Analyzer
This is what separates junior bug hunters from seniors — finding how multiple low-to-medium vulnerabilities **chain together** for critical impact. RAJAN automatically analyzes all discoveries and identifies attack chains. For example: SSRF + Cloud Metadata = credential theft. XSS + Missing HTTPOnly = session hijacking. `.git` exposed + hardcoded secrets = full source code and credentials leak. No other open-source ethical hacking agent does this automatically.

### 🎯 Hard Scope Enforcement
RAJAN strictly enforces the scope you define. If you set `--scope *.example.com`, every single agent checks every URL and hostname before making a request — out-of-scope targets are hard-blocked and logged. This is critical for bug bounty work where testing out-of-scope can get you banned from platforms like HackerOne. Wildcard patterns, subdomain matching, and full URL parsing are all supported.

### 📊 Confidence & Scoring System
Every vulnerability finding RAJAN reports includes a CVSS-style severity score, a confidence percentage (0–100%), and a reliability rating. Findings confirmed with a proof-of-concept get boosted confidence. Potential findings without evidence get flagged as low confidence for manual review. This eliminates false positives and makes reports immediately actionable for real-world use.

### 🤝 Agent-to-Agent Communication
RAJAN's specialized agents don't just take orders from a central controller — they share intelligence with each other through a message bus. When the recon agent discovers subdomains, it publishes them directly to the scanner and web agents. When the scanner finds open ports, the exploit agent is notified automatically. This makes the system feel alive and surfaces connections that a sequential approach would miss.

### 📺 Live Log System
Every action RAJAN takes is printed to the terminal in real time with timestamps, color-coded severity levels, and agent labels — plus a live inline progress bar showing tasks completed, findings discovered, and what's currently running. You can watch exactly what it's doing at any moment.

### 🎬 Session Replay
Replay any past session at any speed. Great for reviewing what happened, learning from the methodology, or demonstrating findings to a client or team.

### 💾 Persistent Memory
Everything is stored in a local SQLite database using WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode — which prevents locking issues during heavy multi-threaded scans, especially on Termux. Sessions survive crashes, phone restarts, and connection drops. Resume any interrupted session with a single command. RAJAN never repeats work it has already done.

### 📊 Professional Reports
Auto-generated reports in both Markdown and HTML with a dark professional theme. Includes executive summary (AI-written), risk summary table, full finding details with MITRE mappings, confidence scores, and remediation advice. Ready to send to clients or submit to bug bounty platforms.

### 📦 Multi-Format Export
Export findings as JSON (for automation), CSV (for spreadsheet analysis), plain TXT (paste anywhere), or pre-formatted HackerOne/Bugcrowd submission templates. All formats in one command.

### 🔔 Notifications
Terminal bell + Termux push notification (Android) + optional email alert when a long autonomous scan completes. You'll never miss a finished session.

### 🛠️ Fully Optional Tools
RAJAN detects which security tools are installed on your system and uses them when available. If `gobuster` isn't installed, it falls back to its own implementation. If `sqlmap` isn't there, it uses its built-in testing logic. It never blocks or crashes because of a missing tool — it adapts.

### ⚙️ Persistent Configuration
All your settings — preferred scan mode, report format, notification preferences, LLM choice — are saved between sessions in a local config file. Set it once, never configure again.

## 💬 Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python3 rajan.py
```
Just start RAJAN and talk to it. It understands natural language.

### Autonomous Scan (CLI)
```bash
# Full autonomous scan
python3 rajan.py --target example.com

# With scope restriction (enforced across all agents)
python3 rajan.py --target example.com --scope "*.example.com"

# Ask before each task (learning mode)
python3 rajan.py --target example.com --semi
```

### While RAJAN Works — Interrupt Commands
Type these anytime during an autonomous scan (no need to stop it):
```
!status          → Progress, tasks done, findings, active agents, re-plan cycles
!stop            → Pause the scan
!resume          → Continue after pause
!report so far   → Show all findings discovered so far
!focus on web    → Shift priority to web application testing
!focus on cloud  → Shift priority to cloud security checks
!skip            → Skip the current task and move to next
!quit            → Save everything cleanly and exit
```
